## :star2: About Honk Menu :star2:

Honk Menu is a mod menu for Untitled Goose Game. Was built for speedrunners to practise clips and tricks, which in tale has now been made into a fun/speedrun mod.

BradCubed was the original creator of TASGoose where a few options were available.

xZeKo has been updating it since, including the new Mod Menu, he changed the name from TASGoose to GooseTools, then found there was another program for goose called [GooseTools](https://github.com/GrantHilgert/GooseTools) so now has changed it to Dev Goose.

After that the SMI_GUI.exe injector was reporting to Chrome and Windows OS that it was a false positive virus, which then promted xZeKo to port it over to Melonloader under the new name of Honk Menu. (So people wouldnt get confused which version they were running)

DevChagrins also helped with a few bits. DevChagrins started building the multiplayer version of Goose before HouseHouse made it multiplayer [GooseNest](https://github.com/DevChagrins/GooseNest).
